## Project Overview

The project focuses on analyzing traffic crashes around Cincinnati using open-source data from the City of Cincinnati website. The dataset contained detailed records of traffic crashes with 3833796 observations and 28 variables. After conducting data cleaning in R, a Tableau dashboard was developed to show key metrics and visualize how different factors contribute to fatal crashes.

## Tools and Packages used
- R: tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2)
- Tableau: Visualization and dashboard creation.

## Key Recommendations

1)	Increase road signage and safe crosswalks, especially near schools and neighborhoods.
2)	Implement mandatory road safety training for ages 17-25 to improve awareness.
3)	Improve road infrastructure, including reflective mirrors and better signage on curved roads.
4)	Install speed cameras and reduce speed limits in high-risk areas.
5)	Enhance nighttime road safety through increased patrolling and reflective lane markings.
